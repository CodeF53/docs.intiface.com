# Quickstart

Welcome to the Intiface Central Quickstart guide! This will get you up and running with Intiface Central with hopefully little work.

Either that or it'll just make you so angry you never use our software again.

## What is Intiface Central? Why do I need it?

You may have seen some games or apps that say they have "Buttplug Compatibility", or that you need Intiface Central (hereby referred to as _IC_) for something like video sync software to work with your toy. If so, you're in the right place!

IC is an application that allows you to connect your sex toy hardware to your computer or mobile phone, as well as test their functionality and configure the hardware as you'd like. After you've gotten IC up and running, you can then have other applications connect to it to control your toys.

Having a hub application like IC handle hardware connections means that the Buttplug/Intiface Team can provide functionality/security updates as needed, without requiring that everyone building applications also update their software. We also do our best to provide backward compatibility, meaning old applications may work with hardware released long after they stopped being developed! 

The goal of IC is to get set up once, then stay mostly out of the way. There is a good chance this quickstart section may be all you need to read of this manual. 

:::tip Nerd Note: Intiface Central in Technical Terms

For the developers and/or nerds in the crowd, here's a quick rundown of what's actually going on in Intiface Central.

Intiface Central is a GUI wrapper around Intiface Engine, which itself is a CLI wrapper around the Buttplug Server. Buttplug Server is the portion of the core Buttplug library that handles communicating with hardware and managing client connection sessions and control, while Buttplug Client is what Applications implement to talk to Buttplug Server. Both Intiface Central and Engine provide UI to start and stop the server, as well as configure it to work with certain types of hardware connections, load user configurations, etc... 

As this manual is meant for all users, we'll be keeping this section short for now. For more information on system architecture, we recommend checking out the [Buttplug Developer Guide](https://docs.buttplug.io/docs/dev-guide).
