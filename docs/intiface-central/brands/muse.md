# MuSE and LoveSpouse

## Does Intiface Support MuSE or LoveSpouse toys?

**No.** At this time, there is no plan to support MuSE or LoveSpouse toys in Intiface. 

While MuSE and LoveSpouse are cheap and readily available through resellers, these toys use an insecure, connectionless communication system that means we cannot easily detect which toys are in the vicinity, and therefore we do not know which toys to present for control. Not only that, these devices are promiscuous, and will accept any connection from any device, as has been outlined in [security projects related to the brand](https://www.whid.ninja/blog/denial-of-pleasure-attacking-unusual-ble-targets-with-a-flipper-zero).

While there are extension projects that may allow connection of LoveSpouse or MuSE devices to our software, we do not provide support for them and cannot answer questions related to them.

For cost-conscious toys, we recommend JoyHub or similar brands. See [IOSTIndex](https://iostindex.com) for a list of all toys supported by Intiface.
